            <h6>INTERPRETING YOUR RESULTS </h6>
            <p>Balance, excess, and insufficiency refer to the state of energy or "Qi" within the meridians of the body, according to Taoist  medicine.</p><br>
            <p><b>Balance:</b> This is the ideal state, where the energy within a meridian is flowing smoothly and evenly. It indicates that the associated organ is functioning optimally and the individual is likely in good health. A balanced state is the goal in energy healing practices, as it suggests harmony within the body.</p><br>
            <p><b>Excess:</b>  This refers to a state where there is too much energy within a meridian. An excess of energy can lead to hyperactivity of the associated organ and may manifest as certain physical or emotional symptoms. For example, an excess in the heart meridian might result in symptoms like restlessness or over-excitement. The goal in this case would be to reduce the excess energy and bring the meridian back into balance.</p><br>
            <p><b>Insufficiency:</b> This is the opposite of excess, referring to a state where there is not enough energy within a meridian. An insufficiency can lead to underactivity of the associated organ and may also manifest as certain symptoms. For example, an insufficiency in the heart meridian might result in symptoms like fatigue or lack of enthusiasm. The goal in this case would be to boost the energy within the meridian and restore balance.</p><br>
            <p>It's important to note that these states are not static but can change over time, depending on various factors like lifestyle, diet, and stress levels. </p><br>

            <p class="text-center"><b>What is a Meridian?</b></p>
            <p>A meridian, also known as a "Jing Luo", is a pathway through which the life-energy known as "Qi" flows. This concept is fundamental to acupuncture, acupressure, and other forms of Taoist  medicine.</p><br>
            <p>Meridians are not physical entities that can be seen or touched, rather they are more like invisible energy pathways that interconnect the body as a holistic system. They form a complex network of 'channels' that link different areas of the body and ensure the smooth flow of Qi, blood, and other vital substances. Each meridian is associated with a specific organ and corresponds to certain physical, emotional, and mental characteristics. For example, the heart meridian is associated with emotions such as joy and happiness, and physical symptoms like palpitations.</p><br>
            <p>There are 12 main meridians in the body, each named after the organ they are associated with: the lung, large intestine, stomach, spleen, heart, small intestine, bladder, kidney, pericardium, triple warmer, gallbladder, and liver meridians.</p><br>
            <p>It's important to note that the concept of meridians is a part of Taoist  medicine and is not recognized in Western medicine. However, many people find treatments based on the meridian system, such as acupuncture and acupressure, to be beneficial for various health conditions.</p><br>
